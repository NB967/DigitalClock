# st.rerun() tells Streamlit to re-run the entire script immediately.

    # Force Streamlit to rerun the script immediately.
    # This is crucial for the clock to update every second without user interaction.
    st.rerun()

# Note: This continuous loop with st.rerun() is suitable for simple, constantly updating displays.
# For more complex Streamlit apps that need real-time updates and also handle user interactions
# efficiently, consider more advanced patterns involving session state and callbacks, or
# Streamlit's own components for long-running tasks if applicable.
