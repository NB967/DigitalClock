# Note: This continuous loop with st.rerun() is suitable for simple, constantly updating displays.
# For more complex Streamlit apps that need real-time updates and also handle user interactions
# efficiently, consider more advanced patterns involving session state and callbacks, or
# Streamlit's own components for long-running tasks if applicable.
